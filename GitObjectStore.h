	is always containing the previous hunks ( therefore they can be safely 
	deleted ).
 
	Note:
	It can only delete objects that are loose. Note also that it can delete 
	an object even if other objects depend on it, creating corrupted object 
	stores if used wrongly.
 
	Note2: This functionality is not really needed anymore, since the index
	will not write any objects to the database until writeTree is performed.
